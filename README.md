# create_quechua_dataset

## Description

This project downloads the `quechua-ser` dataset, preprocesses the data and
creates **speaker independent** as well as **gender balanced** train/test splits.

`quechua-ser` contains 9 emotional categories as well as dimensional values for arousal, dominance and valence. There are 6 actors (3 male, 3 female).

The dataset is downloaded from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/media/Quechua_Collao_for_Speech_Emotion_Recognition/20292516?file=37361143). Further information can be found in the [related paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01855-9/).
